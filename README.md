# Customer Support Agent Leveraging Openai and Azure ML
## Business Problem
Business Problem Case Study:
Intelligent Customer Support Automation for E-Commerce Retailer

### Company Overview:
SwiftCart.inc, a mid-sized e-commerce platform specializing in fast-fashion and electronics, receives 15,000+ customer support tickets monthly via email, chat, and social media. Their customer support team of 50 agents struggles to manage the high volume, leading to delayed responses, inconsistent resolutions, and declining customer satisfaction (CSAT score dropped to 72% from 89% in 12 months).

### Current Challenges
#### Manual Ticket Triage:

* Agents spend 40% of their time manually categorizing tickets (e.g., "returns," "technical issues," "order tracking") and prioritizing urgency.

* Misrouted tickets increase resolution time by 35%.

* Inconsistent Responses:

* New agents lack expertise to handle complex queries, resulting in repetitive escalations to senior staff.

* Template-based responses fail to address nuanced issues, causing 22% repeat inquiries.

#### Scalability Issues:

* Seasonal spikes (e.g., holiday sales) overwhelm the team, leading to 48-hour response delays and lost revenue from cart abandonment.

#### Operational Costs:

* Hiring/training costs have risen by 30% to manage attrition and workload.

### Proposed Solution
Build an AI-powered Customer Support Agent using OpenAI and Azure Machine Learning to automate ticket management:

#### Automated Ticket Categorization:

* Use OpenAI’s GPT-4 to analyze ticket content and classify tickets into categories (e.g., "refund," "delivery delay") with 95% accuracy.

* Azure ML pipelines will preprocess data (historical tickets) and fine-tune models for domain-specific terminology.

#### Dynamic Prioritization Engine:

* Integrate Azure ML to predict urgency based on sentiment analysis, customer tier (e.g., VIP), and issue type.

* Critical tickets (e.g., payment failures) are flagged for immediate action.

#### Response Generation & Agent Assist:

* OpenAI generates draft responses for agents, reducing manual effort.

* Azure ML monitors response quality and iteratively improves suggestions via feedback loops.

#### Seamless Integration:

* Deploy the solution via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to integrate with SwiftCart’s Zendesk ticketing system and CRM.

#### Expected Outcomes
* 50% reduction in resolution time through accurate categorization and prioritization.

* 30% lower operational costs by automating repetitive tasks.

* 20% improvement in CSAT scores via personalized, consistent responses.

* Scalability to handle 2x ticket volume during peak seasons without additional hires.

### Implementation Steps
#### Data Pipeline Setup:
* Data ingestion and Data labeling
    * Use Azure Data factory on Microsoft Fabric platform to aggregate and anonymize 2 years of historical ticket data.

    * Label datasets for training (category, priority, resolution).

* Model Development:

    * Fine-tune OpenAI models on SwiftCart’s data using Azure ML Studio.

    * Build a prioritization model with Azure AutoML for sentiment/urgency prediction.

* Deployment & Testing:

    * A/B test the AI agent vs. human agents on a subset of tickets.

    * Use Azure Monitor to track performance metrics (accuracy, latency).

* Agent Training & Rollout:

    * Train support teams to use AI-generated suggestions and override incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion
By integrating OpenAI and Azure ML, SwiftCart can transform its customer support operations into a proactive, cost-efficient function. The solution not only addresses immediate inefficiencies but also lays the foundation for future AI-driven enhancements (e.g., chatbots, predictive analytics). This aligns with their strategic goal to increase customer lifetime value (CLV) by 25% within 18 months.

### Key Metrics Post-Implementation:

* First-response time: < 2 hours (down from 12 hours).

* Ticket misrouting rate: < 5% (down from 30%).

* Operational cost savings: $1.2M annually.
