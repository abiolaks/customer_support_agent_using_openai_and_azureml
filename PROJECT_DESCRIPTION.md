# Project Description

## Overview

The project tackles the significant business problem of efficiently managing a large influx of customer support tickets, which often results in delayed responses, misprioritization, and inconsistent quality in customer service. Traditional support systems struggle to scale, leading to increased operational costs and customer dissatisfaction. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this project aims to revolutionize the customer support process. LLMs can analyze and understand the content of support tickets, categorize them based on urgency and subject matter, and generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

<br> 

In this project, we are developing a system that will use LLMs for tasks such as sentiment analysis, ticket categorization, and response generation, ensuring that critical issues are prioritized and handled promptly. Azure ML will provide the infrastructure needed to deploy, scale, and manage the AI models efficiently.

 <br>

The problem statement centers around the need to reduce the costs associated with manual ticket handling, improve response times, and enhance customer satisfaction. By automating these processes, companies can significantly lower operational expenses related to support staff and improve the overall customer experience.
